Machine Problem (Taguiam_MP) contains codes on the following problems:
  1. Define an R function that removes NA values from a vector.
  2. Define an R function that computes the factorial of given an integer argument. The output should be a vector of length 1.
  3. Define an R function that sorts a given vector in decreasing order. The output should be a vector of the same length. It should accept both numeric or character vectors.
  4. Create a function to compute for your net pay at work.
  5. Create a function that accepts a vector and and integer n and returns nth highest number
  6. Create a function that computes the compound interest of an investment given the rate, time, and initial amount or principal.
  7. Create a function isPrime(n) that accepts an integer and outputs a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) depending whether the integer is a prime number or not.
